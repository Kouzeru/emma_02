<h2>External Terminal</h2>
<p>
To use Emma 02 with an external terminal additional software is needed. So far I have only been able to get this to work on Windows and Linux.
</p>
<p>
Of course serial terminal software is needed. For windows I have used and tested <a href="https://www.emtec.com/download.html#zocfiles">ZOC7</a>. For Ubuntu I have tested with <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Minicom">Minicom</a>. Any other serial terminal emulation should work
</p>
<p>
Both Emma 02 and serial terminal software will communicate with a serial port on the host PC. So one option to use this would be to connect the two serial ports with a cable; I have not even tried this! Instead I recommend to use a serial port emulator. The serial port emulator will create two virtual ports on the host PC and connect them. One of the ports should be specified in Emma 02 (in Terminal Setup window) and the second in the serial terminal.

<p>
On windows I have tested both the free <a href="http://com0com.sourceforge.net/">Null-modem emulator (com0com)</a> and the <a href="https://www.eltima.com/vspd-comparison-chart.html">Virtual Serial Port Driver</a> from Eltima Software.
</p>
<p>
On Linux I have tested the free <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/tty0tty/">Null-modem emulator (tty0tty)</a>.
</p>
<p>
Terminal emulation is NOT possible when using intel 8275 emulation on the Elf 2000.
</p>
<p>
Following sub chapters describe terminal options, not all are available depending on emulated computer.
</p>
<h3>Serial mode</h3>
<p>
This mode is using serial I/O via the Q line and one of the EF lines. To use this mode make sure that the checkbox Uart 16450 is NOT selected (in Terminal Setup window). 
</p>
<p>
Note that in this mode the transmit and receive (choice button T/R) baudrates need to be equal and, the speed options are depending on the selected computer.
</p>
<p>
Serial mode is not available for the MS 2000.
</p>
<h3>Uart</h3>
<p>
Two different uart are available: the 16450 for the Elf 2000 and MS2000 and the CDP1854 for the different Elf computers.
</p>
<p>
This uart mode can be use by selecting the Uart 16450 or Uart CDP1854 checkbox (in Terminal Setup window). Only basic usage of the 16450 and a simple mode 1 emulation for the CDP1854 is implemented.
</p>
<p>
In this mode the transmit and (T) and receive (R) baudrates can be different and the speed can be set between 50 to 19200 baud.
</p>
<h3>Reversed EF / Q</h3>
<p>
To use the terminal with reversed EF input and/or reversed Q output select the applicable checkbox (in Terminal Setup window).
