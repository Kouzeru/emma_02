<h1>FRED 2 Emulator</h1>
<p>
This emulator will emulate the FRED 2 computer. The FRED (Flexible Recreational and Educational Device) concept was used by RCA for multiple prototype computers eventually resulting in the release of computers like the VIP and Studio II. The FRED 2 emulated by Emma 02 is based on the information found in this <a href="http://www.retrotechnology.com/memship/Sarnoff_FRED_manual_W_R_H.pdf">manual</a> as well as Paul Robson's <a href="https://github.com/paulscottrobson/fred">FRED emulator</a>. It is very similar to the FRED 1 but is running on the CDP 1801 instead of the SYSTEM 00 chip set and as such is able to run FEL-1. Additional information about the FRED 2 can be found on the <a href="http://www.emma02.hobby-site.com">Emma 02</a> site.
