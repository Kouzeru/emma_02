<h2>ROM and RAM Files</h2>
<p>
The CDP18S600 Microboard has 5 ROM and/or RAM socket, '1 Socket' for 1 ROM or RAM chip and '4 Socket' for 4 ROM or RAM chips. For details see the CDP18S600 manual. In the main Emma 02 window the size of the '1 Socket' and '4 Socket' chips can be selected (2Kx8, 4Kx8 or 8Kx8). All '4 socket' chips will have the same size.
</p>
<p>
Use the 'Setup - 1' or 'Setup - 4' button to specify ROM/RAM location, memory type (ROM, RAM or CPU RAM) and/or to disable the socket. Depending on the chip size selected different location options will be available (as described in the CDP18S600 manual). The '4 Socket' chip locations will be in consecutive order with U20 on the lowest address followed by U19, U18 and last U17.
</p>
<p>
Default settting is loading ut71.bin in U20 (2K), 8K RAM in Socket 1 (U21) and 2K RAM in U19. Default CDP18S600 ROM/RAM file location is the CDP18S600 directory (located in the application data directory, see <a href="MainFile.htm">Directory and File Structure</a>). To change the location use the 'ROM Uxx' or 'RAM Uxx' buttons to browse for the file, do the same to change the filename or type in a new file name in the text field. Data can be loaded via files in either ROM or RAM. Files can also be loaded into RAM in run time by using the Memory Access buttons.
</p>
<p>
The binary, Intel hex and RCS Elf Emulator hex format are supported.
