<h2>ROM Files</h2>
<p>
The VIP2K Membership Card emulator can be started with a specific ROM or RAM file loaded. To specify which file to load use the 'ROM' or 'RAM' button to browse for the file, or type in a new file name in the text field. Default VIP2K Membership Card ROM location is the VIP2K directory (located in the application data directory, see <a href="MainFile.htm">Directory and File Structure</a>). 
</p>
<p>
Note that ROM files in binary format, normally using extension .bin, will be loaded at address 0. Intel hex and RCS Elf emulator hex format include storage locations and as such will be loaded in the specified address location.
