<h2>Device Ports</h2>
<p>
When the 'Device Ports' button is pressed a pop-up window will appear with all input/output ports and EF flags listed for all supported Elf 2000 HW extensions. All input/output ports can be defined from 1 to 7 depending on what the Elf 2000 software expects and what HW you want to emulate. The same goes for the EF flags which can be specified from 1 to 4. The most likely values are defined as default.
</p>
<p>
If EF1, EF2 and EF3 are not used in the defined configuration they will default to '1'. This default value can be changed by selecting '0' for any of these EFs under the 'Unused EF' heading. 
</p>
<p>
Note that no input/output port or EF flag should have the same value if the extension is used at the same time.
