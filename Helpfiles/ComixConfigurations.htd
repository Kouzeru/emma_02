<h2>COMIX Conifgurations</h2>
<p>
To emulate the COMIX-35 first select the COMX-35 tab and then make sure 'DRAM refresh' is not selected. Recommended COMX ROM file is comx35.1.2.bin. This version includes a fix to handle the lack of DRAM refresh in the COMIX. The only difference with 1.1 is that the interrupt executes one extra LDA R0 which will secure that R0 is constantly incremented (be it with a slower speed compared to the COMX). The increment of R0 will secure that some games will run correctly on the COMIX as they use R0 as a random generator (one example is Space Invaders).

Alternatively load one of the pre defined COMIX configuration under the menu 'File/Configuration/Load/COMIX'. Both a bare and SB version are included.
