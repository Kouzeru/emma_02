<h2>Cassette Support (wave Files)</h2>
<h3>Real Cassette</h3>
<p>
Real cassette is not supported for the FRED emulator.

For details on how to use a real cassette player connected to a PC and Emma 02 please see the chapter: <a href="MainRealCassette.htm">Real Cassette Support</a>
</p>
<h3>Wave Files</h3>
<p>
The easiest and fastest way to load or save a .wav file into the FRED emulator is by making sure both options 'Turbo LOAD/SAVE' and 'Auto LOAD/SAVE' are checked, this should be the default setting when the Emma 02 Emulator is started for the first time. Depending on which type you choose, i.e. automatic or manual please follow the instructions below.  
</p>
<p>
This chapter describes using FEL-1 for saving and the front panel buttons for loading.
</p>
<p>
Note that we have not been able to load any of the saved wav files on a real FRED. If you have/need that option, please let me know and we can do some trouble shooting on this. Changing the wave file settings might impact the usability of the wav files on a real FRED, see also below.
</p>
<h4>Auto LOAD/SAVE</h4>
<p>
Default settings, to use this make sure 'Auto LOAD/SAVE' is checked.
</p>
<p>
To load a .wav file into the FRED first start the Emma 02 emulator select the FRED tab and then use the 'Load' configuration from menu 'File / Configuration / Load'. Alternatively make sure 'Auto boot' is NOT selected before starting the FRED. Select a .wav file in the Emma 02 window by selecting the 'Cassette' push button. Now start the FRED emulator (start button on Cosmicos tab). On start-up the FRED will activate the wav file until a 'stop' tone is found after which the emulator will stop the tape. Loading can be started by switching the 'READ' switch on the control panel. The cassette PLAY button should go green until loading is finalized.
</p>
<p>
To save a .wav file from the FRED, select a .wav file in the Emma 02 window by selecting the 'Cassette' push button. Make sure fel.bin as RAM file and 'Auto boot' is selected. Start the FRED and press 'C' the cassette REC button should go red until saving is finalized. 
</p>
<p>
For both save and load make sure a .wav file is selected in the Emma 02 window before using the save and load instructions otherwise the FRED emulator will hang on the load (until you manually start a .wav file) or with a save the wav sound will not be written to any file.
</p>
<h4>Manual LOAD/SAVE</h4>
<p>
To use this make sure 'Auto LOAD/SAVE' is NOT checked. Otherwise handling is the same as for 'Auto LOAD/SAVE' except that PLAY and REC buttons need to be pressed manually. 
</p>
<h4>Turbo LOAD/SAVE</h4>
<p>
When Turbo LOAD/SAVE is selected the emulator will increase speed when a wav file is played to allow faster LOAD and SAVE possibility in the emulator. The speed of the Turbo LOAD/SAVE can be changed; default is 15 MHz, which works ok on both my desktop and laptop. Too high values will not run ok on slower PCs as all CPU power will be used by the emulator. On my vista desktop vista limits CPU usage to 50% max but on my windows 2000 laptop CPU usage gets up to 100% and can possibly hang the laptop for the duration of the LOAD or SAVE command.

<h4>Wave File Settings</h4>
<h4>Wave File Settings</h4>
<p>
Via the 'Settings' drop down menu select 'Wav File and Real Cassette Settings' to change the wave file settings used for saving or loading a '.wav' file. The following subchapters describe applicable settings in more detail. Settings for saving to a file are the 'Wave volume', 'Bit Rate' and 'Bits per sample', setting for loading a wav file are the 'Wav file conversion' and 'Reversed Polarity'. The 'Cassette conversion' and 'Input Channel' are only used for Real Cassette loading.
</p>
<h5>Wave volume</h5>
<p>
1 to 15 (where 15 is the loudest)
</p>
<h5>Bit Rate</h5> 
<p>
11025, 22050, 44100 or 88200 (samples per second)
</p>
<h5>Bits per sample</h5>
<p>
8 or 16
</p>
<h5>Wav file conversion</h5> 
<p>
None of these settings are used for the FRED tape emulator.
