<h2>Directory and File Structure</h2>
<p>
After initial start-up of Emma 02 a default directory and file structure will be made available according to the sub chapters below. These files can be re-installed at any time by using the menu item 'File/Re-install/1802 Software Files'.
</p>
<p>
The location for the data directory is default set to:
</p>
<UL>
<LI>Windows Vista and later: C:\Users\<I>username</I>\AppData\Roaming\Emma 02
<LI>XP: C:\Documents and Settings\<I>username</I>\Application Data\Emma 02
<LI>Mac OSX: ~/Emma 02
<LI>Linux: ~/emma_02_data
</UL>
<p>
Note that when an older versions of Emma 02 was used previously the default data directory will have been set to:
</p>
<UL>
<LI>Mac OSX: ~/Documents/emma_02
<LI>Linux: ~/Documents/emma_02
</UL>
</p>
<p>
To change the location of these files use the menu item 'File/Configuration/Change Data Directory'. A small window will open where with the 'browse' button a new location can be selected. After this 2 options are available: either to only save the new location ('Save' button) or save and move the existing data directory and files to the new location ('Move & Save' button). If the save only option is used the data folder should be moved manually. When moving the folder to another disk the process could take a few minutes (depending on the disk speed). In all cases all settings will be set to default as in the 'Set Default (All)' menu action.
</p>
<p>
<B>Note:</B> when installing a new version of Emma 02 the data directory will NOT be re-installed automatically. If so desired copy the latest files by using the menu item 'File/Re-install/1802 Software Files'.
