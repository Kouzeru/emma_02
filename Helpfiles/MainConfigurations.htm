<h2>Configurations</h2>
<p>
After initial start-up of Emma 02 default configurations will be made available according to the sub chapters below. These files can be re-installed at any time by using the menu item 'File/Re-install/Configuration Files'.
</p>
<p>
To load a pre defined computer configurations select one of items under the menu 'File/Configuration/Load'. Some of the configurations included in Emma 02 are described n the chapters below. For all computers the default setting is included in the 'Default' menu option.
</p>
<p>
To save a specific computer configuration, first make sure all setting for that computer are correct. Then select 'File/Configuration/Save'. A new window will open where it is possible to specify the 'Item Name' and optionally the 'Sub Menu Name'. After pressing save the new configuration will be saved under the specified menu. If a configuration was loaded before the save request, a new window will open to confirm overwrite, to replace the old menu or to create a new one.
</p>
<p>
The following settings are NOT saved in individual computer configurations but will be saved when saving the Emma 02 configuration on exit or manually when using menu item 'File/Configuration/Save All':
<UL>
<LI>Any video setup items like colours and border sizes
<LI>Any key mapping definition
<LI>Superboard online settings like player name, location, email, home page, bookmarks and aliases
</UL>
</p>
<p>
To delete a configuration from the menu select 'File/Configuration/Delete' and the configuration to be deleted.
</p>
<p>
<B>Note:</B> when installing a new version of Emma 02 the configuration menus will NOT be re-installed automatically. If so desired copy the latest files by using the menu item 'File/Re-install/COnfiguration Files'.
