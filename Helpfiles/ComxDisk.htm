<h2>Disk Support</h2>
<p>
To use disk images select fdc.bin in any available slot (CARD 1 if no expansion box is used). At least one COMX disk image is needed (as DISK 1) to boot COMX DOS. The Emulator has installed the master disk image 'dos.1.4+f&m.disk.tools.img'. When DOS NEW is used the COMX DOS should be initiated with the message:
</p>
<pre>
COMX DOS  V1.4
COPYRIGHT BY COMX - 1984</pre>
<p>
After this any DOS command or utility from the master disk can be used, for explanation of COMX DOS commands please see the COMX DOS manual available on the <a href="http://www.comxclub.hobby-site.com">Dutch COMX Club</a>.
</p>
<p>
To change the disks at run time just select a different filename via the DISK x button or type a name in the text field. To eject the disk use the eject button or remove the filename in the text field.
</p>
<h3>
Disk Format and boot initialization
</h3>
<p>
To create a new disk image including COMX DOS boot data, keep 'dos.1.4+f&m.disk.tools.img' specified as DISK 1 and any filename as DISK 2. After using DOS URUN,"INIT" the format/init program will be started, press any key and 'Y' for being sure, then select drive no: 2. After this 3 Different type of disks can be created by selecting the options:
</p>
<h4>
1. Double sided disk, 35 tracks per side with a total size of 140K:
</h4>
<p>
- Double track density: N<br>
- Double sided: 2
</p>
<h4>
2. Single sided disk, 70 tracks with a total size of 140K:
</h4>
<p>
- Double track density: Y
</p>
<h4>
3. Single sided disk, 35 tracks with a total size of 70K:
</h4>
<p>
- Double track density: N<br>
- Double sided: 1
</p>
<p>
After this selection, again confirm that you are sure and the format process will start.
