<h2>Zoom Level and Full Screen Mode</h2>
<p>
With the zoom level function the emulated screen size can be specified. Default setting is 1 or 2 (depending on the emulated video type) where every actual dot of the emulated video screen is the same size (1) or twice the size (2) on the PC screen. The zoom level value can be specified from 0.5 and upwards (depending on PC screen size and resolution).
</p>
<p>
To change the zoom level fill in the desired value, use the spin buttons or just resize the emulated window by draging the bottom right corner. The zoom level for the video terminal is specified with dedicated buttons within the 'Terminal' field of the Emma 02 window.
</p>
<p>
Zooming is possible either with or withour using a 'floating point' value as zoom level. Default setting is using floating point values, this can be changed for all emulated computers via menu item 'Settings / Window / Enable Floating Point Zooming'. A larger part of the screen or window will be used when using floating point values. However more PC processor load will be used, so if the screen emulation is too slow deselect the 'floating point' zooming.
</p><p>
Switching between window mode and full screen mode can be done by pressing F3 from the emulated computer window, the 'Full Screen' button on the Emma 02 window or via the Setting/Window menu option. When a Video Terminal and video emulation are used simultaniously (Elf and Cosmicos) the video terminal will switch to full screen first, pressing F3 again will switch the specified video emulation to full screen.
