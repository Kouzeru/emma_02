<h1>VIP2K Membership Card Emulator</h1>
<p>
This emulator will emulate the VIP2K Membership Card. Additional information about the Membership Card can be found on the <a href="http://www.emma02.hobby-site.com">Emma 02</a> site.
</p>
<p>
Note that in the default setting a VT100 terminal is supported but no VT window will open. This as the VIP2K when running the standard ROM doesn't use any terminal I/O except for the file transfer functions of the monitor and BASIC. The file I/O will work even if no video terminal is opened. To open (or show) the video terminal window select the 'Show' checkbox.
