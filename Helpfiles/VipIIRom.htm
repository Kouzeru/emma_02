<h2>ROM Files</h2>
<p>
To run the Cosmac Vip II emulator at least the FPB and Cosmac Vip system ROM files should be specified in the 'ROM 1' (fpb.rom) and 'ROM 2' (vip.rom) fields. Default Cosmac Vip II ROM location is the Vip directory (located in the application data directory, see <a href="MainFile.htm">Directory and File Structure</a>). To change the location use the 'ROM 1' or 'ROM 2' button to browse for the file, do the same to change the filename or type in a new file name in the text field.

<p>
The binary, Intel hex and RCS Elf Emulator hex format are supported.
