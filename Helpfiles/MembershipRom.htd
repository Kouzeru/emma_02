<h2>ROM and RAM Files</h2>
<p>
The Membership Card emulator can be started with a specific ROM or RAM file loaded. To specify which file to load use the 'ROM' or 'RAM' button to browse for the file, or type in a new file name in the text field. Default Membership Card ROM location is the Membership Card directory (located in the application data directory, see <a href="MainFile.htm">Directory and File Structure</a>). 
</p>
<p>
To load SW into RAM instead of ROM select the toggle ROM/RAM button (2 arrows) to switch a button from 'ROM' to 'RAM' and vice versa.
</p>
<p>
Note that RAM/ROM files in binary format, normally using extension .bin, will be loaded at address 0 unless the '32 KB RAM - 32 KB ROM' has been selected. In that case binary files will be loaded at hex 8000. Intel hex and RCS Elf emulator hex format include storage locations and as such will be loaded in the specified address location.
</p>
<p>
Additional RAM files can be loaded after starting the emulator by using the 'LOAD' button.
