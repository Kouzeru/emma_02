<h2>Control Window</h2>
<p>
The main CDP18S020 Evaluation Kit control board can be shown by selecting check box 'CDP18S020 Window'. 
</p>
<p>
The main board includes the switches, buttons and status leds. Emulation of the leds can take a lot of PC CPU power so default these are only updated every 500 ms. This can be changed in the Emma 02 window by changing the 'Leds' field. When 0 ms (or nothing) is specfied the leds will be updated in real time. Note that this will take a lot of CPU load and as such make the CDP18S020 run very slow due to the frequent changes in both CPU status, data and address leds.
</p>
<p>
In STEP mode all leds are updated in real time.
</p>
