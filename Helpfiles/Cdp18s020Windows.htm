<h3>Control Windows</h3>
<p>
The main CDP18S020 Evaluation Kit control board can be shown by selecting check box 'CDP18S020 Window'. 
</p>
<p>
The main board includes the switches, buttons and status LEDs. Emulation of the LEDs can take a lot of PC CPU power so default these are only updated every 500 ms. This can be changed in the Emma 02 window by changing the 'LEDs' field. When 0 ms (or nothing) is specified the LEDs will be updated in real time. Note that this will take a lot of CPU load and as such make the CDP18S020 run very slow due to the frequent changes in both CPU status, data and address LEDs.
</p>
<p>
In STEP mode all LEDs are updated in real time.
