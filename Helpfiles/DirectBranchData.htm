<h1>Branch data</h1>
<p>
Some code will need branch tables or use 2 bytes to identify an address location. As an example COMX BASIC uses R4/R5 for subroutine handling. Where SEP R4 is a subroutine call to the address specified in the 2 bytes following. SEP R5 is used as subroutine return. For these cases the 'branch data' bytes can be defined in the Direct assembler by typing ':address' or marking the data bytes as 'Branch' via the procedure described in chapter 'Marking specific types'. By doing this also the branch data will be corrected when using insert, delete or copy commands. All 'Branch data' will be shown in <FONT COLOR="DARK ORCHID">purple</FONT> text.

For example doing an insert on address hex 8000 in the following example:
<pre>
8000: NOP
8001: LDI 10
8003: SEP R5
8004: SEP R4
8005: <FONT COLOR="DARK ORCHID">8001</FONT>    (when typed in as :8001, and shown in <FONT COLOR="DARK ORCHID">purple</FONT>)
8005: SEP R5
</pre>
<br>will result in:
<pre>
8000: NOP
8001: NOP
8002: LDI 10
8004: SEP R5
8005: SEP R4
8006: <FONT COLOR="DARK ORCHID">8002</FONT>    
8008: SEP R5
</pre>
