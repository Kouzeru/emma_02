<h2>XMODEM Support </h2>
<p>
Default and simplest method to transfer files over the XMODEM to/from the Elf 2000 emulator is by making sure both options 'Turbo' and 'Auto' are checked. Depending on which type you choose, i.e. automatic or manual please follow the instructions below.  
</p>
<p>
Also make sure 'XMODEM' is enabled and shown by pressing the 'Toggle: XMODEM - HEX' button (2 arrows) to toggle between XMODEM and HEX. XMODEM support is enabled by default.
</p>
<h3>Auto file transfer</h3>
<p>
Default settings, to use this make sure 'Auto' is checked. The automatic mode will work with the Elf/OS xr, xrb, xs, xsb and yr commands.
</p>
<p>
To transfer a file to or from the Elf 2000 select the file in the file selector window by pressing the XMODEM button. After that give the xr, xrb, xs, xsb or yr command in Elf/OS. For the yr command it is possible to select multiple files in the file selector window, Emma 02 will also send the filenames to Elf/OS. For all other file transfers only one file will be used, if multiple files were selected only the first will be used.
</p>
<p>
If no file is specified before starting the file transfer the Elf 2000 will wait for the transfer to start. If this happens unselect the auto checkbox and try a manual transfer.</p>
</p>
<h3>Manual file transfer</h3>
<p>
To use this make sure 'Auto' is NOT checked.  
</p>
<p>
To transfer a file to or from the Elf 2000 select the file in the file selctor window by pressing the XMODEM button. After that start the file transfer command on the emulated Elf 2000. Then press play for transferring to the Elf 2000 and press record for transfering from the Elf 2000.
</p>
<h3>Turbo file transfer</h3>
<p>
When Turbo is selected the emulator will increase speed during file transfer to allow faster file transferlity in the emulator. The speed of the Turbo mode can be changed; default is 15 MHz, which works ok on both my desktop and laptop. Too high values will not run ok on slower PCs as all CPU power will be used by the emulator. 
</p>
<h3>YMODEM Receive (yr) Packet Size</h3>
<p>
Via the VT Setup button it is possible to change the Packet Size used for the YMODEM receive function (used in the yr command). Default this is set to 1024 ansd is changeable to 128 like is used in XMODEM commands like xr and xs.
