<p>
To run the COMX emulator with the Diagnostic Board select checkbox 'Diagboard'. The choice box can be set to 'on' to start the diagnostic SW or to 'off' to start BASIC with the diagnostic board connected.
</p>
<p>
By default the following ROMs will be selected:
<ul>
<li>diag_pal1.bin, mapped to 0000-0FFF instead of BASIC ROM (if the diagnostic board is set to 'on'). BASIC ROM will be switched back 
 on the first INP 1 instruction.
<li>diag_pal2_v1.1.bin, mapped to C0000-D7FF. This v1.1 version will perform the extended ROM check on BASIC ROM file comx35.1.1.bin.
</ul>
Next to this additional RAM will be selected from D800-DFFF.

<ul>
<li>diag_pal1.bin, diag_pal2.bin, with extended ROM check for the original COMX BASIC ROM (comx35.bin).
<li>diag_ntsc1.bin, diag_ntsc2_v1.1.bin, NTSC version with ROM check for comx35.1.1.bin
<li>diag_ntsc1.bin, diag_ntsc2.bin, NTSC versiom with ROM check for the original COMX BASIC ROM (comx35.bin).
</ul>
The NTSC ROM set will be selected automatically when an NTSC COMX is selcted. To change from 1.1 to original version use the 'setup' button.
</p>
<p>

<ul>
<li>ROM checksum: on or off
