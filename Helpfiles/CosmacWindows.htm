<h3>Control Windows</h3>
<p>
The main Elf control board (and hex kepad and led module if configured) can be shown by selecting check box 'Elf Windows'. 
</p>
<p>
The main board includes the switches, buttons, status LEDs and TIL311 displays. Emulation of the TIL311 displays and the LEDs can take a lot of PC CPU power so default these are only updated every 100 ms. This can be changed in the Emma 02 window by changing the 'LEDs' field. When 0 ms (or nothing) is specified the TIL311 displays and LEDs will be updated in real time.
