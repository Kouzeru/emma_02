<h2>Video Terminal Simulation</h2>
<p>
Currently 2 video terminals can be simulated, the DEC VT52 and VT100. Note this is a simulation, i.e. all functionality is simulated and NOT running the original terminal software. Both terminals support all ESC sequences and full functionality (except for self test features and keyboard leds), however as I don't have Elf software supporting everything and also don't have an actual terminal not all functionality has been tested. Font roms are included, but not 100% original. For the VT52 there are 2 fonts vt52.a.bin and vt52.b.bin, not sure which is more correct. Please feel free to drop me an email with comments on functionality or font roms!
</p>
<p>
Vt-100 emulation is NOT possible when using intel 8275 emulation.

<h3>Uart 16450</h3>
<p>
This mode can be use by selecting the Uart 16450 checkbox (in Terminal Setup window). Only basic usage of the 16450 is implemented.
</p>
<p>
Note that in this mode the transmit and (T) and receive (R) baudrates can be different and the speed can be set between 50 to 19200 baud.
</p>
<h3>Serial mode</h3>
<p>
This mode is using serial output is on the Q line, serial input is default set on the EF3 line. To use this mode make sure that the checkbox Uart 16450 is NOT selected (in Terminal Setup window). 
</p>
<p>
Note that in this mode the transmit and receive (choice button T/R) baudrates need to be equal and the speed can only be set between 300 to 3600 baud.
</p>
<h3>Stretch</h3>
<p>
The original VT terminals repeated every 'dot' on the screen if defined as 'on' in the font. This resulted in 'stretched' characters. The detail of the character is actually higher if this function is not used. To enable select the Strecth check box.
</p>
<h3>Bell</h3>
<p>
In the terminal Setup window either a frequency for the bell sound can be selected (default 800 Hz) or a wav file. If a wav file is specified the sound contained in that file will be played when a bell is activated on the simulated VT.
</p>
<h3>Baud rate detached from CPU speed</h3>
<p>
Default the baud rate of the emulated video terminal is calculated based on a machine running on clock speed of around 2 MHz. The calculation is done using the current CPU speed to allow the emulated machine to run on any speed without need for baud rate changes. This means that Emma 02 might use a faster baud rate then specified if the CPU speed is increased over 2 MHz.
</p>
<p>
This can be changed (in the terminal Setup window) by selecting 'Baud rate detached from CPU speed'. With this option the selected baud rate will always be the same even in the CPU speed is increased. As a result some SW might not run unless the CPU speed is equal to the machine it was created for. For example 1802 code that was designed for a 2 MHz machine and 4800 baud, will not run on 4 MHz and 4800, instead it will only work on 9600 baud.
</p>
<h3>Log</h3>
<p>
To log all VT terminal output to a file (terminal.log) select the Log check box (in Terminal Setup window). If the terminal.log file already exists a new file is created with a sequence number every time the emulated computer window is initiated. E.g. the file 'terminal.log' is used the first time, next time the file 'terminal.1.log' will be created.
</p>
<h3>VT100</h3>
<h4>Set-up</h4>
<p>
VT100 Set-up screens are simulated and can be started by pressing F8 (see also chapter <a href="MainFunctionKeys.htm">Function and Hot Keys</a>). When saving settings with CTRL S they will be used next time a VT100 will be used for the Elf 2000.
