<h2>Video Setup</h2>
<p>
Via the Video Setup window ('Video Setup' button) the emulated colours,  screen border size and for CDP1861/1864 the horizontal scale can be specified. If the computer emulation is running the new setting can be tested by pressing the 'Test' button. To save all settings (and exit) press 'Save'. Default settings can be restored by pressing 'Default'. In some cases specific buttons are available for pre defined colour configurations.  
</p>
<p>
All borders can be specified between 0 and 100, where 1 equals one pixel on the emulated video. When using zoom factors other than 1 also the border is increased with the same zoom factor.

<p>
For the CDP1861 (Pixie) and CDP1864 video emulation a 'horizontal scale' can be specified. This value (1 to 5) is used for an additional horizontal zoom. Both CDP1861 and 1864 video types use a resolution of 64 by 128 (192 for CDP1864) pixels, so to show a picture with a similar ratio as on a TV screen an additional zoom is needed. Default CDP 1861 video is set to horizontal scale 3 and CDP 1864 to 4, resulting in a ratio of 192x128 (CPD1861) and 256x192 (CDP1864). If 'Floating Point Zooming' is used floating point values are allowed to be used as scale, see also <a href="MainZoom.htm">Zoom Level and Full Screen Mode</a>. Note that the horizontal (x) border for the CDP 1861 and 1864 can only be specified in steps of the specified horizontal scale (rounded to the lowest integer), when using floating point values the border size will not be exactly as specified in pixels.
