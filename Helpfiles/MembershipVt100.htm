<h2>Video Terminal Simulation</h2>
<p>
Currently 2 video terminals can be simulated, the DEC VT52 and VT100. Note this is a simulation, i.e. all functionality is simulated and NOT running the original terminal software. Both terminals support all ESC sequences and full functionality (except for self test features and keyboard leds), however as I don't have software supporting everything and also don't have an actual terminal not all functionality has been tested. Font roms are included, but not 100% original. For the VT52 there are 2 fonts vt52.a.bin and vt52.b.bin, not sure which is more correct. Please feel free to drop me an email with comments on functionality or font roms!

<h3>Video Terminal LOAD/SAVE</h3>
<h4>Auto LOAD/SAVE</h4>
<p>
Default settings, to use this make sure 'Auto LOAD/SAVE' is checked.
</p>
<p>
To load a terminal file into the Membership Card monitor, start the Emma 02 emulator and select one of the Membership Card monitor configurations (File/Configuration/Load/Monitor). Then start the Membership Card emulator (start button on Membership Card tab). Select a file in the Emma 02 window by selecting the 'File' push button. Start the load command by pressing 'L' or 'I'.
</p>
<p>
To save a file from the Membership Card monitor, select a file in the Emma 02 window by selecting the 'File' push button. Start the save command by pressing 'S' or 'C'. When the save is finished the Membership Card leds should flash on / off, at that time press a key in the video terminal window.
</p>
<p>
For both save and load make sure a file is selected in the Emma 02 window before using the save and load instructions otherwise the Membership Card emulator will hang on the load (until you manually start a file) or with a save the terminal ouotput will not be written to any file.
</p>
<h4>Manual LOAD/SAVE</h4>
<p>
To use this make sure 'Auto LOAD/SAVE' is NOT checked. This setting is more like the terminal LOAD/SAVE handling with the real Membership Card monitor.  
</p>
<p>
To load a terminal file into the Membership Card monitor, start the Emma 02 emulator and select one of the Membership Card monitor configurations (File/Configuration/Load/Monitor). Then start the Membership Card emulator (start button on Membership Card tab). Select a file in the Emma 02 window by selecting the 'File' push button. Start the load command by pressing 'L' or 'I'. When the terminal states 'Ready to LOAD Program' then press the 'play' button on the main Emma 02 window.
</p>
<p>
To save a file from the Membership Card monitor, select a file in the Emma 02 window by selecting the 'File' push button. Start the save command by pressing 'S' or 'C'. When the terminal states 'Ready to SAVE Program' then press the 'record' button on the main Emma 02 window. When the save is finished the Membership Card leds should flash on / off, at that time press a key in the video terminal window.
</p>
<h3>Serial mode</h3>
<p>
Currently no Uart is supported. The serial mode is using serial output on the Q line, serial input is using the EF3 line. 
</p>
<p>
Note that the transmit and receive (choice button T/R) baudrates are equal and the speed can be set between 300 to 9600 baud.
</p>
<h3>Stretch</h3>
<p>
The original VT terminals repeated every 'dot' on the screen if defined as 'on' in the font. This resulted in 'stretched' characters. The detail of the character is actually higher if this function is not used. To enable select the Strecth check box.
</p>
<h3>Reversed EF / Q</h3>
<p>
To use the Membership Card with reversed EF input and/or reversed Q output select the applicable checkbox (in Terminal Setup window). 
</p>
<h3>Log</h3>
<p>
To log all VT terminal output to a file (terminal.log) select the Log check box (in Terminal Setup window). If the terminal.log file already exists a new file is created with a sequence number every time the emulated computer window is initiated. E.g. the file 'terminal.log' is used the first time, next time the file 'terminal.1.log' will be created.
</p>
<h3>Bell</h3>
<p>
In the terminal Setup window either a frequency for the bell sound can be selected (default 800 Hz) or a wav file. If a wav file is specified the sound contained in that file will be played when a bell is activated on the simulated VT.
</p>
<h3>Baud rate detached from CPU speed</h3>
<p>
Default the baud rate of the emulated video terminal is calculated based on a machine running on clock speed of around 2 MHz. The calculation is done using the current CPU speed to allow the emulated machine to run on any speed without need for baud rate changes. This means that Emma 02 might use a faster baud rate then specified if the CPU speed is increased over 2 MHz.
</p>
<p>
This can be changed (in the terminal Setup window) by selecting 'Baud rate detached from CPU speed'. With this option the selected baud rate will always be the same even in the CPU speed is increased. As a result some SW might not run unless the CPU speed is equal to the machine it was created for. For example 1802 code that was designed for a 2 MHz machine and 4800 baud, will not run on 4 MHz and 4800, instead it will only work on 9600 baud.
</p>
<h3>VT100</h3>
<h4>Set-up</h4>
<p>
VT100 Set-up screens are simulated and can be started by pressing F8 (see also chapter <a href="MainFunctionKeys.htm">Function and Hot Keys</a>). When saving settings with CTRL S they will be used next time a VT100 will be used for the Membership Card.
