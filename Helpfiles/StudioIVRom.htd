<h2>ROM Files</h2>
<p>
To run the RCA Studio IV emulator the ROM dump from the original Studio IV should be specified in the 'ROM' field. Default Studio IV ROM location is the StudioIV directory (located in the application data directory, see <a href="MainFile.htm">Directory and File Structure</a>) and the default filename is 'am4kbas 32K 2020.bin'. To change the location use the 'ROM' button to browse for the file, do the same to change the filename or type in a new file name in the text field.
</p>
<p>
The binary, Intel hex and RCS Elf Emulator hex format are supported.
</p>
<p>
Similar as for the main ROM any cartridge ROM can be specified via the 'CART' button. No cartridge games are included as none have been discovered. 
</p>
<h3>Tiny BASIC</h3>
<p>
Tiny BASIC as released on the VIP VP700 board was also ported by RCA to the Studio IV. Unfortunately only half (second 2K) of the original code has been discovered however I have been able to port the VIP routines for the missing half to the Studio IV. So the code provided here is not fully original.
</p>
<p>
Four versions are provided:
</p>
<OL>
<LI>PAL for use with 32K RAM
<LI>NTSC for use with 32K RAM
<LI>PAL for use with 4K RAM
<LI>NTSC for use with 4K RAM
</OL>
<p>
My assumption is that 4K was as developed by RCA as Studio IV color memory is located at address 0x2800 limiting the RAM options. For the 32K RAM version I moved the color memory to 0x1000.
