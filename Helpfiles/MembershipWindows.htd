<h2>Control Windows</h2>
<p>
The Membership Card control panel can be emulated.
</p>
<p>
The control panel includes the buttons and leds. Emulation of the TIL311 displays and the leds can take a lot of PC CPU power so default these are only updated every 100 ms. This can be changed in the Emma 02 window by changing the 'Leds' field. When 0 ms (or nothing) is specfied the TIL311 displays and leds will be updated in real time.  
</p>
<p>
The buttons and leds are always connected to 1802 OUT/INP 5.
