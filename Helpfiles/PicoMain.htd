<h1>Pico/Elf V2 Emulator</h1>
<p>
This emulator will emulate the Pico/Elf V2 computer, which is a self build kit designed by Mike Riley. Additional information about the Pico/Elf can be found on Mikes <a href="https://www.elf-emulation.com/picoelf.html">Pico/Elf V2</a> page. Pico/Elf V2 is an evolution of the Micro/Elf. Pico/Elf removes the address display, data displays, and input togges along with associated circutiry in order to add an RS232 port, ROM socket and IDE/CF interface, allowing for a complete machine capable of running Elf/OS.
