<h2>Key Mapping</h2>
<p>
To change or view the hex keypad to PC key mapping select the 'Key Map' button. 
</p>
<p>
Depending on the emulated computer different options will be available. As described in the following chapters.
</p>
<h3>IN Button</h3>
<p>
For the Elf 2000, Cosmicos, Cosmac Elf, Netronics Elf II, Quest Super Elf and ETI 660 the IN Button can be specified. Default the IN Button is mapped to the PC Insert key on Windows and PC Control key on Mac OSX. 
</p>
<p>
To change first select IN Buttonn. After this 'Press Key' is shown on the button; now press the PC key it should be mapped to. Any PC key that is mapped twice will be shown in a red colour, avoid double mapping as the emulator will not be able to handle this.
</p>
<h3>Standard Hex Mapping</h3>
<p>
The standard mapping of hexadecimal keys 0 to F can either be done manually or in 2 default settings:
<UL>
<LI>Button 'on Location': keys are mapped in a similar layout as the hex keypad
<LI>Button 'on Character': digits and characters are mapped to the same key on the PC keyboard (i.e. 0 to 0, A to A etc).
</UL>
</p>
<p>
Default keys are mapped 'on Character' for all emulators.
</p>
<p>
To make a manual change first select the desired keypad key button. After this 'Press Key' is shown on the selected button; now press the PC key it should be mapped to. Any PC key that is mapped twice will be shown in a red colour, avoid double mapping as the emulator will not be able to handle this.
</p>
<p>
Make sure to use the 'Save' button to save settings this will also close the hex Keypad Mapping window.
</p>
<p>
Default keys will be mapped using the PC numeric keypad unless the menu item 'Settings / Use Numeric Keypad' is unselected. The default key map setting is optimized for a US keyboard, which can be changed via menu 'Settings / Default Keyboard'. For non defined keyboards user defined settings can be defined as described in chapter 'Default Keyboard' below.
</p>
<h3>Auto and Arcade Key Definition</h3>
<p>
To simplify 'game play' hexadecimal keys can be mapped to two sets. The second set can be shown by pressing the 'Switch Set' button on the Key Mapping window. The window header will indicate if set 1 or 2 is shown. Additionally 'Auto Key Definition' can be selected to load key settings from the 'keydefinition.txt' file. Definitions in this file try (where possible) to map as in the follwing table (listed keys are valid if Default Keyboard 'US' is selected):

<p>
The arcade mapping (fire and direction keys) will always be shown in the keymap window. To switch from player 1 to 2 press the 'SwitchPlayer' button or on the Cosmac VIP (with VP590 or VP580), RCA Studio II, RCA Studio III / Victory MPT-02 and Visicom COM-100 press the 'Switch Pad' button. 
</p>
<p>
Auto Key Definition is not supported for the Elf 2000 and Cosmicos.
</p>
<p>
The 'keydefinition.txt' file can be found in the data directory, for location details please see <a href="MainFile.htm">Directory and File Structure</a>). The 'keydefinition.txt' file lists most games and required mapping. To add games use the following format:
<pre>
name: game_filename
pad a<i>X</i>:0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F
pad b<i>X</i>:0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F
pad a<i>X</i> npp: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F
pad b<i>X</i> npp: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F
in: PC key
game keys: up1, left1, right1, down1, fire1, up2, left2, right2, down2, fire2
sim a2
sim b2
</pre>
Where:
<UL>
<LI>X is set 1 or 2
<LI>0 to F for 'pad' definitions are PC key values, value 0 is 'not used'.
<LI>game keys; up1: up player 1, left1: left player 1 etc. Values are hex keys 0 to F. 10 is 'not used' and 11 is the Elf IN button. The game key definition is just to visualize the correct arcade keys in the keymap window.
<LI>Definitions for 'nnp' are for use without numeric keypad.
<LI>in defines the PC key value for the Elf in key.
<LI>sim a2 and sim b2 define diagonal directions for Studio II clones, i.e. up/left direction when pressing both arrow up and arrow left for player A.
</UL>
<p>
For exampe:
<pre>
name: paddles.ch8
pad a2:0,0,0,32,328,0,330,370,314,0,316,0,0,0,0,0
game keys:20,4,6,20,F,20,7,9,20,E
</pre>
Where player 1 left will be defines as arrow left (PC key 314, hex key 4), right: arrow right (316, hex 6), fire: space (32, hex F). For player 2 left: Numpad 4 (328, hex 7), right: Numpad 6 (330, hex 9) and fire: Enter (370, hex E). 
</p>
<p>
Additionally any value can be represented by a text string. All text strings have to be defined in the keyboard layout files as described in the 'Default Keyboard' chapter below.
</p>
<h3>Second Keypad</h3>
<p>
When using the Cosmac VIP (with VP590 or VP580), RCA Studio II, RCA Studio III / Victory MPT-02 and Visicom COM-100 emulators a second keypad is or can be configured. In this mode a button 'Switch pad' will be available to switch from keypad A to B and back. Note that the 'on Character' button for the VIP keypad B will map all keys to the PC numeric keypad.
</p>
<h3>Default Keyboard</h3>
<p>
Default keyboard mapping is defined for a US keyboard layout. However a few different other layouts are provided and can be selected via the menu 'Settings / Default Keyboard'. Currently layouts for Dutch, German, French, Swedish / Finnish and US are provided as well as an option to specify a user specific definition. If you desire a specific mapping for your keyboard please drop me an email with your requirements and I'll try to add it in the next release.
</p>
<p>
To create a definition for your own layout first locate one of the keyboard definition files located in the data directory (see chapter <a href="MainFile.htm">Directory and File Structure</a>), for example us.ini (for the US keyboard layout). Copy this file and rename the new file to user_defined.ini. Change any key value in the file to your desired default setting. 
</p>
<p>
The following key sets can be changed / defined for computers with a HEX keypad:
<UL>
<LI>Keypad B, Arcade set (UP, LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN and FIRE) identified by 'B_A_' followed by the direction
<LI>Keypad A, on Character for keys 0 to 9 identified by 'A_C_' followed by the key number (0 to 9)
<LI>Keypad A, on Location identified by 'A_L_' followed by the key number, where 1 is top left corner and 16 bottom right of the keypad.
<LI>Keypad B, on Location identified by 'B_L_' followed by the key number, where 1 is top left corner and 16 bottom right of the keypad.
</UL>
</p>
<p>
The following key sets can be changed / defined for Studio II clones:
<UL>
<LI>Keypad B, Arcade set (UP, LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN and FIRE) identified by 'B_A_' followed by the direction and _ST
<LI>Keypad A, on Location identified by 'A_L_' followed by the key number and _ST, where 1 is top left corner and 9 bottom right of the keypad; number 10 is key 0.
<LI>Keypad B, on Location identified by 'B_L_' followed by the key number and _ST, where 1 is top left corner and 9 bottom right of the keypad; number 10 is key 0.
<LI>Keypad B, on Location if 'Use Numeric Keypad' is NOT selected identified by 'B_L_NNP_' followed by the key number and _ST, where 1 is top left corner and 9 bottom right of the keypad; number 10 is key 0.
</UL>
</p>
<p>
For the TMC-600 a subset of keys can be changes as listed under [TMC600], regular keys are identified by 'Key' and shift keys by 'KeyShift' both followed by a 2 digit number as defined in the table below.
