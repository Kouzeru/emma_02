<h2>Chip 8 Interpreter</h2>
<p>
The Studio II chip 8 interpreter was designed by Marcel van Tongeren and is based on the VIP chip 8 interpreter. This interpreter also runs on the RCA Studio III / Victory MPT-02.
</p>
<p>
To use the chip 8 interpreter in Emma 02 load the configuration 'Chip 8' or 'Multi-Cart' alternatively select 'chip8.bin' as ROM and any chip 8 file as CART.
</p>

On HW this chip 8 interpreter can run on a RCA Studio III / Victory MPT-02 with the 40th Anniversary Multi-Cart as designed by FLiP. Due to HW differences of the RCA Studio III / Victory MPT-02 compared with the VIP there are some limitations:
<UL>
<LI>Free RAM is limited to 0x9F bytes. Chip 8 code writing to memory will try to emulate writing to RAM by changing register I to a value within 0xB00 and 0xB9F (addressing RCA Studio III / Victory MPT-02 memory 0x800-0x89F). This will work for the simplest cases but most SW will need re-coding if RAM is used.
<LI>Chip 8 size should be lass than 0xB00 bytes.
<LI>Keys A to F do not exist on a RCA Studio III / Victory MPT-02, these keys are mapped to keypad two 1 (A) to 6 (F).

Memory map:

    0 - 0x2FF:  Interpreter
0x300 - 0x7FF:  Chip 8 SW using an offset of 0x100 
		mapped to chip 8 memory 0x200 - 0x6FF.
                i.e. a JP to address 0x200 in chip 8 
		code will jump to Victory MPT-02  
		address 0x300.
0x800 - 0x89F:  RAM free to use by chip 8 SW with an 1
		offset of 0x300. i.e. to address RAM 
		register I should contain a value 
		between 0xB00-0xB9F.
0x8A0 - 0x8CF:  Chip 8 Stack
0x8D0 - 0x8EF:  Chip 8 interpreter work area
0x8F0 - 0x8FF:  Content V0 - VF
0x900 - 0x9FF:  Display RAM
0xA00 - 0xBFF:  Not used
0xC00 - 0xFFF:  Chip 8 SW using an offset of 0x500 
		mapped to chip 8 memory 0x700 - 0xAFF.
                i.e. a JP to address 0x700 in chip 8 
		code will jump to Victory MPT-02  
		address 0xC00.

Note: JP or CALL in Studio II chip 8 is not possible to address range 0x800-0xBFF.

Memory map as seen by the chip 8 interpreter:

0x200 - 0x6FF:  Chip 8 SW stored in Victory MPT-02  
		memory 0x300 - 0x7FF
0x700 - 0xAFF:  Chip 8 SW stored in Victory MPT-02 
		memory 0xC00 - 0xFFF
0xB00 - 0xB9F:  RAM free to use by chip 8 SW stored 
		in Victory MPT-02 Memory 0x800 - 0x89F
