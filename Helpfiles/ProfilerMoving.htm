The scrollbar (yelow ellipse) can be used to move through the code where the top of the scrollbar will start at address 0 and bottom at FFFF. 'Arrow keys up or down' will move the code one instuction or address up or down and 'shift arrow up/down' will move one page up/down. Alternatively an address can be specified in the 'Move to:' field (orange ellipse) which will move the profiler directly to the specified address.
