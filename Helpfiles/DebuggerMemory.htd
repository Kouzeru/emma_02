<h2>Memory Dump</h2>
<p>
To use the memory dump functions of the debugger first select the 'Memory Dump' tab of the choice book on the debugger tab.
</p>
<p>
The default view will show the first 256 bytes of main CPU memory from the emulated computer. To show another part of memory type in any address value in the top left address field.  
</p>
<p>
To change the value of a 'memory address' select the value and change it. Note both ROM and RAM values can be changed! 
</p>
<p>
When running a COMX, TMC600 or Pecom emulation the actual CDP 1870 characters will be shown in black and white per address value at the right of the hexadecimal values. When running other computers the values will be shown in a regular character set.
</p>
<p>
The following additional features are available on windows and OS X, currently not implemented in the Linux version:  Move up or down 1 page by using the spin button left from the address field. After editing one byte the next address will be selected automatically. After the last byte of the page is changed the next page will be shown. 
</p>
<p>
Next to the main CPU memory other memory dump options are available by changing the 'Memory' choice button:
</p>
<UL>
<LI>Type: memory types defined for the main CPU memory, see also 'Memory Type' chapter below.
<LI>1870 Page: CDP 1870 Page memory
<LI>1870 Character: CDP 1870 Character memory, for the Telmac TMC-600 Character ROM is shown and for both TMC-600 and Cidelsa only 6 bits are used.
<LI>1870 Colour: CDP 1870 Colour RAM, only used by the Telmac TMC-600 and Cidelsa. The TMC-600 uses one nibble (4 bits) to define colour and blink mode of the character on the same location in page memory. the Cidelsa uses 3 bits to define the colour of the charcater and line in the same location in character memory.
<LI>6845 Character: MC6845 Character ROM
<LI>6847 Character: MC6847 Character RAM, both internal and external roms are shown; internal from hexadecimal address 0 to 1FF and external from 200 to 7FF. 
<LI>6847 Video RAM: The first half will show bits 0 to 7 of and the second half bit 8 to 11.
<LI>TMS Video RAM: Only 16384 addresses will be viewable.
<LI>VT Video RAM
<LI>1862/1864 Colour
<LI>8275 Character
<LI>8275 Video RAM
</UL>
<p>
In all modes except 'Type', memory values are shown and can be changed per memory page of 256 bytes, in 'Type' mode memory types (ROM, RAM, Video RAM etc) is shown and can be changed. 
</p>
<p>
Note when using the any of the video modes above only the used address will be shown, the number of addresses depends on the emulated computer and video settings.
</p>
<h3>Memory Type</h3>
<p>
The memory type of the main 64K CPU memory will be shown as soon as type 'Type' is selected.  One field defines one page, i.e. 256 bytes of memory, so the top left field defines address 0000 to 00FF.  To change the type of a memory page select the value and change it, for definition of types see following details:
</p>
<h4>Values allowed in COMX emulation</h4> 
<p>
space = UNDEFINED<br>
. = RAM<br>
R = ROM<br>
PR = 1870 Page RAM<br>
CR = 1870 Character RAM<br>
M5 = MC6845 Video RAM<br>
MR = MC6845 Register<br>
CE = COMX Expansion ROM copy<br>
CF = COMX Floppy disk ROM copy
</p>
<p>
Note that M5 and MR are only allowed if the 80 column card is configured. Also when changing any of these values the COMX emulation might not work anymore!
</p>
<h4>Values allowed in Cosmac Elf, Netronics Elf II and Quest Super Elf emulation</h4> 
<p>
space = UNDEFINED<br>
. = RAM<br>
R = ROM<br>
M5 = MC6845 Video RAM<br>
MR = MC6845 Register<br>
M7 = MC6847 Video RAM<br>
</p>
<p>
Note that M5 and MR are only allowed if the MC6845 video mode is selected and M7 only if the MC6847 video mode is selected. Also when changing any of these values the Elf emulation might not work anymore!
</p>
<h4>Values allowed in Cosmac Elf 2000, Telmac 1800, Telmac 2000, Oscom Nano and ETI 660 emulation</h4> 
<p>
space = UNDEFINED<br>
. = RAM<br>
R = ROM<br>
</p>
<p>
When changing any of these values the Cosmac Elf 2000, Telmac 1800, Telmac 2000, Oscom Nano and/or ETI 660 emulation might not work anymore!
</p>
<h4>Values allowed in RCA Studio II, RCA Studio III / Victory MPT-02 and Visicom COM-100 emulation</h4> 
<p>
space = UNDEFINED<br>
. = RAM<br>
R = ROM<br>
M. = Mapped RAM<br>
C. = Victory Colour RAM Access<br>
</p>
<p>
When changing any of these values the RCA Studio II, RCA Studio III / Victory MPT-02 and/or Visicom COM-100 emulation might not work anymore!
</p>
<h4>Values allowed in Cidelsa, Telmac TMC 600 and Pecom emulation</h4> 
<p>
space = UNDEFINED<br>
. = RAM<br>
R = ROM<br>
PR = 1870 Page RAM<br>
CR = 1870 Character RAM<br>
</p>
<p>
When changing any of these values the Cidelsa, Telmac TMC 600 and/or Pecom emulation might not work anymore!
</p>
<h3>COMX Expansion Slot, 32K RAM Card and EPROM Switchboard</h3>
<p>
To switch COMX expansion slot from the debugger use the 'Slot' field (values 1 to 4). Expansion roms are connected from address C000 to DFFF. 
</p>
<p>
When a slot with the 32K RAM card is selected it is possible to select an 8K RAM bank in the 'RAM Bank' field (values 0 to 3). When a slot with the F&M EPROM Switchboard or COMX SuperBoard is selected it is possible to select an 8K EPROM bank in the 'Eprom Bank' field (values 0 to 4 for the EPROM board and 0 to F for the SuperBoard). 
</p>
<p>
The switchable slot address of the expansion ROM, RAM Bank and Eprom will be shown in the same colour as the 'Slot' text.
</p>
<h3>Elf EMS Memory and RAM Pager</h3>
<p>
To switch Elf EMS memory page from the debugger use the 'EMS' field (hexadecimal values 0 to 1F). EMS pages are connected from address 8000 to BFFF.
</p>
<p>
To switch Elf memory pager from the debugger use the 'Pager' fields (first field values 0 to F, second field values 0 to FF). Memory pager pages are connected from address 1000 to FFFF in blocks of 4K. Page 0 is always connected from address 0 to 0FFF. The switchable 4K page is indicated by the fist field and the selected pager by the second field.
</p>
<p>
The switchable EMS address will be shown in the same colour as the 'EMS' text and the switchable Pager pages in the same colour as the 'Pager' text. When switching the switchable 4K page the colour will move as well.
</p>
<h3>Save</h3>
<p>
To save memory values within the CPU or video memory space, use the 'Save' button. The full memory will be saved, i.e. 64K in CPU mode, for video modes size is depending on setting of video RAM size.
</p>
<p>
To save in binary format use file extension '.bin' and to save in text format use file extension '.txt'. If the specified file already exists the filename will be given a number starting with 1.
</p>
<h3>Copy</h3>
<p>
To copy memory values within the CPU or video memory space<A HREF=""></A> use the 'Copy' button. First make sure to specify start and end address of the source and start (to) address of the destination location, all in hexadecimal format.
