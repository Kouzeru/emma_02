<h3>Control Windows</h3>
<p>
The main Elf control board can be shown by selecting check box 'Elf Windows'. 
</p>
<p>
The main board includes the switches, buttons, status leds and TIL311 displays. Emulation of the TIL311 displays and the leds can take a lot of PC CPU power so default these are only updated every 100 ms. This can be changed in the Emma 02 window by changing the 'Leds' field. When 0 ms (or nothing) is specfied the TIL311 displays and leds will be updated in real time.
