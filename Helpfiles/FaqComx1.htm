<h1>How do I run a game or program on the COMX emulator?</h1>
<p>
The easiest way to run your favourite game or program on the COMX emulator is to load and run a '.comx' file by using the memory RUN feature (see steps below). All available SW is stored in the Comx directory (located in the application data directory, see <a href="MainFile.htm">Directory and File Structure</a>) at installation.
</p>
<p>
1. Start the Emma 02 emulator and make sure the COMX tab is selected<br>
2. Press 'Start'<br>
3. Press the 'RUN' button under 'Memory Access' in the Emma 02 window<br>
4. Select the '.comx' file for the game or program that you want to run and 'double click' it or press 'Open'<br>
</p>
<p>
Software can also be loaded from disk images or wav files, see help chapters on <a href="ComxDisk.htm">disk</a> and <a href="ComxCassette.htm">cassette</a> usage.
