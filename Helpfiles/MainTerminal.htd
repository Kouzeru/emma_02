<h2>Video Terminal Simulation</h2>
<p>
Currently 2 video terminals can be simulated, the DEC VT52 and VT100. Note this is a simulation, i.e. all functionality is simulated and NOT running the original terminal software. Both terminals support all ESC sequences and full functionality (except for self test features and keyboard LEDs), however as I don't have software supporting everything and also don't have an actual terminal not all functionality has been tested. Font ROMs are included, but not 100% original. For the VT52 there are 2 fonts vt52.a.bin and vt52.b.bin, not sure which is more correct. Please feel free to drop me an email with comments on functionality or font ROMs!
</p>
<p>
Next to the terminal simulation also external terminal software can be used, for more details see: <a href="MainExternalTerminal.htm">External Terminal</a>
</p>
<p>
Terminal emulation is NOT possible when using intel 8275 emulation on the Elf 2000.
</p>
<p>
For details and manuals for the VT52 and VT100 see <a href="http://vt100.net">VT100.net</a>
</p>
<p>
Following sub chapters describe terminal options, not all are available depending on emulated computer.
</p>
<h3>Serial mode</h3>
<p>
This mode is using serial I/O via the Q line and one of the EF lines. To use this mode make sure that the checkbox Uart 16450 is NOT selected (in Terminal Setup window). 
</p>
<p>
Note that in this mode the transmit and receive (choice button T/R) baud rates need to be equal and, the speed options are depending on the selected computer.
</p>
<p>
Serial mode is not available for the MS 2000.
</p>
<h3>Uart</h3>
<p>
Two different uart are available: the 16450 for the Elf 2000 and MS2000 and the CDP1854 for the different Elf computers.
</p>
<p>
This uart mode can be use by selecting the Uart 16450 or Uart CDP1854 checkbox (in Terminal Setup window). Only basic usage of the 16450 and a simple mode 1 emulation for the CDP1854 is implemented.
</p>
<p>
In this mode the transmit and (T) and receive (R) baud rates can be different.
</p> 
<h3>Stretch Dot</h3>
<p>
The original VT terminals repeated every 'dot' on the screen if defined as 'on' in the font. This resulted in 'stretched' characters. The detail of the character is actually higher if this function is not used. To enable select the Strecth check box.
</p>
<h3>Reversed EF / Q</h3>
<p>
To use the VT with reversed EF input and/or reversed Q output select the applicable checkbox (in Terminal Setup window). 
</p>
<h3>Video Terminal LOAD/SAVE</h3>
<p>
This option is only implemented for the Membership Card and can be used in combination with the monitor software.
</p>
<h4>Auto LOAD/SAVE</h4>
<p>
Default settings, to use this make sure 'Auto LOAD/SAVE' is checked.
</p>
<p>
To load a terminal file into the Membership Card monitor, start the Emma 02 emulator and select one of the Membership Card monitor configurations (File/Configuration/Load/Monitor). Then start the Membership Card emulator (start button on Membership Card tab). Select a file in the Emma 02 window by selecting the 'File' push button. Start the load command by pressing 'L' or 'I'.
</p>
<p>
To save a file from the Membership Card monitor, select a file in the Emma 02 window by selecting the 'File' push button. Start the save command by pressing 'S' or 'C'. When the save is finished the Membership Card LEDs should flash on / off, at that time press a key in the video terminal window.
</p>
<p>
For both save and load make sure a file is selected in the Emma 02 window before using the save and load instructions otherwise the Membership Card emulator will hang on the load (until you manually start a file) or with a save the terminal ouotput will not be written to any file.
</p>
<h4>Manual LOAD/SAVE</h4>
<p>
To use this make sure 'Auto LOAD/SAVE' is NOT checked. This setting is more like the terminal LOAD/SAVE handling with the real Membership Card monitor.  
</p>
<p>
To load a terminal file into the Membership Card monitor, start the Emma 02 emulator and select one of the Membership Card monitor configurations (File/Configuration/Load/Monitor). Then start the Membership Card emulator (start button on Membership Card tab). Select a file in the Emma 02 window by selecting the 'File' push button. Start the load command by pressing 'L' or 'I'. When the terminal states 'Ready to LOAD Program' then press the 'play' button on the main Emma 02 window.
</p>
<p>
To save a file from the Membership Card monitor, select a file in the Emma 02 window by selecting the 'File' push button. Start the save command by pressing 'S' or 'C'. When the terminal states 'Ready to SAVE Program' then press the 'record' button on the main Emma 02 window. When the save is finished the Membership Card LEDs should flash on / off, at that time press a key in the video terminal window.
</p>
<h3>Bell</h3>
<p>
In the terminal Setup window either a frequency for the bell sound can be selected (default 800 Hz) or a wav file. If a wav file is specified the sound contained in that file will be played when a bell is activated on the simulated VT.
</p>
<h3>Log</h3>
<p>
To log all VT terminal output to a file (terminal.log) select the Log check box (in Terminal Setup window). If the terminal.log file already exists a new file is created with a sequence number every time the emulated computer window is initiated. E.g. the file 'terminal.log' is used the first time, next time the file 'terminal.1.log' will be created.
</p>
<h3>VT100</h3>
<h4>Set-up</h4>
<p>
VT100 Set-up screens are simulated and can be started by pressing F8 (see also chapter <a href="MainFunctionKeys.htm">Function and Hot Keys</a>). When saving settings with CTRL S they will be used next time a VT100 will be used.
