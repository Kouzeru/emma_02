<h2>Installation Elf/Os 2.8</h2>
<p>
Elf Os is a disk based operating system for Elf class computers designed by Mike Riley, for additional information see also: <a href="http://www.elf-emulation.com">Elf/1802 Emulation</a>.
</p>
<p>
For Elf/Os installation on the Elf 2000 please follow the Elf 2000 manual available on the Spare Time Gizmos site: <a href="http://www.sparetimegizmos.com/Downloads/Elf2k.pdf">Elf 2000 User's Manual</a>.
</p>
<p>
When using Elf/Os in Intel-8275 video note that the LOAD command will not work due to the fact that it uses the same memory location as the video memory. To solve this a LOAD command is included which is located at address 7400-74AE. This version is provided in file LOAD-8275.hex as well as stored on the elf2k-installation.ide.
</p>
<p>
The elf2k-installation.ide file includes a pre installed Elf/Os. The installation file will be renamed to elf2k.ide if the used file doesn't exist.
